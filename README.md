# 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice  

This repository contains my **DSA practice programs**, where I have implemented and explored essential data structures and algorithms.  
Each concept is organized in its own file, focusing on **clarity, implementation, and understanding of core principles**.

## 📌 Topics Covered  

The repository includes implementations of the following **essential DSA concepts**:  

- 🔗 **Linked List** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- 📚 **Stack** (using arrays & linked lists)  
- 📊 **Queue** (normal, circular, priority queue)  
- 🌲 **Binary Trees** (basic operations, traversals)  
- 🌳 **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**  
- 🔍 **Searching Algorithms** (linear search, binary search)  
- 🔄 **Sorting Algorithms** (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quicksort)  
- 📈 **Dynamic Programming (basic problems)**  

Each program is written in a **separate file** for easy reference and testing.
